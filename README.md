# daily-day-planner
So this one was actually fairly easy, I made a spiffy for loop to take military time and convert it into AM/PM with no hassle, then I simply reused the variable (ampm) to set the key to read and write into local storage. I also plugged those variables directly into the HTML of the divs I was creating. Most of the work is in a for loop and a function for the Btn class. The hardest part was figuring out how to use the provided stylesheet to get the look I wanted.
